# Rendering binaural audios for moving sources


# Forms

To evaluate how realistically the rendered audios are perceived, a set of listening tests were conducted using an online plataform (<a href = 'https://www.questionpro.com/'>Question Pro</a>). The questions were designed to evaluate whether the subject would notice the sensation of speed and distance from  the  sound source.  Comparisons between the different interpolation and extrapolation techniques were also presented, as well as a parallel with and without specular reflections, to verify if thatapproach would improve the virtualization. Lastly a comparison between fixed HATO at 0â—¦ and the use of the closest HATO to the source azimuth angle were presented, in order to verify how noticeable thedifference would be. Table 1 shows the questions and the available answers in the survey.

# Questions

    - 20 m/s
    - 30 m/s 
    - 10 m/s

- In which audios does the sound source appear to move faster? (Siren)
  - 30 m/s
  - 10 m/s
  - 20 m/s

- In which the source audio sound seems more distant? (Siren)
    - 5 meters
    - 2 meters 
    - 10 meters

- In which the source audio sound seems more distant? (Noise)
    - 2 meters
    - 10 meters 
    - 5 meters
