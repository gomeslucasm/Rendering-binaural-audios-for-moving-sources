# Rendering binaural audios for moving sources

To evaluate how realistically the rendered audios are perceived, a set of listening tests were conducted using an online plataform (<a href = 'https://www.questionpro.com/'>Question Pro</a>)

# Forms

The questions were designed to evaluate whether the subject would notice the sensation of speed anddistance  from  the  sound source.  Comparisons  between  the  different interpolation  and extrapolationtechniques were also presented, as well as a parallel with and without specular reflections, to verify if thatapproach would improve the virtualization. Lastly a comparison between fixed HATO at 0â—¦and the useof the closest HATO to the source azimuth angle were presented, in order to verify how noticeable thedifference would be. Table 1 shows the questions and the available answers in the survey.
