# Rendering binaural signals for moving sources

Here you can find the files used in the subjective evaluation of the research carried out for the article **Rendering binaural signals for moving sources, presented at the Reproduced Sound 2020 conference**.

# Survey

To evaluate how realistically the rendered audios are perceived, a set of listening tests were conducted using an online platform (<a href = 'https://www.questionpro.com/'>Question Pro</a>). The questions were designed to evaluate whether the subject would notice the sensation of speed and distance from a sound source passing-by. Comparisons among the different interpolation and extrapolation techniques were also tested, as well as a parallel test with and without specular reflections, to verify if the approach used would improve the virtualization. Lastly, a comparison between fixed HATO at 0◦ and the use of the closest HATO to the source azimuth angle was evaluated in order to verify how noticeable the differences would be.
